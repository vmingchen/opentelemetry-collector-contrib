# Receiver Creator

This receiver can instantiate other receivers at runtime based on whether observed endpoints match a configured rule. To use the receiver creator, you must first configure one or more [observers](../../extension/observer/README.md) that will discover networked endpoints that you may be interested in. The configured rules will be evaluated for each endpoint discovered. If the rule evaluates to true then the receiver for that rule will be started against the matched endpoint.

## Config

**watch_observers**

A list of observers previously defined to be run in the `extensions` section. receiver_creator will watch for endpoints generated by these observers.

**receivers**

A map of receiver names (e.g. `redis/1`) to a template for when and how to instantiate that receiver.

**receivers.&lt;receiver_type/id&gt;.rule**

Rule expression using [expvar syntax](https://github.com/antonmedv/expr/blob/master/docs/Language-Definition.md). Variables available are detailed below in [Rule Expressions](#rule-expressions).

**receivers.&lt;receiver_type/id&gt;.config**

This is configuration that will be used when creating the receiver at runtime.

This option can use static and dynamic configuration values. Static values are normal YAML values. However the value can also be dynamically constructed from the discovered endpoint object. Dynamic values are surrounded by backticks (\`). If a literal backtick is needed use \\` to escape it. Dynamic values can be used with static values in which case they are concatenated. For example:

```yaml
config:
   secure_url: https://`pod.labels["secure_host"]`
```

The value of `secure_url` will be `https://` concatenated with the value of the `secure_host` label.

This can also be used when the discovered endpoint needs to be changed dynamically. For instance, suppose the IP `1.2.3.4` is discovered without a port but the port needs to be set inside endpoint. You could do:

```yaml
config:
   endpoint: `endpoint`:8080
```

## Rule Expressions

Each rule must start with `type.(pod|port) &&` such that the rule matches only one endpoint type. Depending on the type of endpoint the rule is targeting it will have different variables available.

### Pod

| Variable    | Description                       |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| type.pod    | `true`                            |
| name        | name of the pod                   |
| labels      | map of labels set on the pod      |
| annotations | map of annotations set on the pod |

### Port

| Variable        | Description                          |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| type.port       | `true`                               |
| name            | container port name                  |
| port            | port number                          |
| pod.name        | name of the owning pod               |
| pod.labels      | map of labels of the owning pod      |
| pod.annotations | map of annotations of the owning pod |
| protocol        | `TCP` or `UDP`                       |



## Example

```yaml
extensions:
  # Configures the Kubernetes observer to watch for pod start and stop events.
  k8s_observer:

receivers:
  receiver_creator/1:
    # Name of the extensions to watch for endpoints to start and stop.
    watch_observers: [k8s_observer]
    receivers:
      prometheus_simple:
        # Configure prometheus scraping if standard prometheus annotations are set on the pod.
        rule: type.pod && annotations["prometheus.io/scrape"] == "true"
        config:
          metrics_path: '`"prometheus.io/path" in annotations ? annotations["prometheus.io/path"] : "/metrics"`'
          endpoint: '`endpoint`:`"prometheus.io/port" in annotations ? annotations["prometheus.io/port"] : 9090`'

      redis/1:
        # If this rule matches an instance of this receiver will be started.
        rule: type.port && port == 6379
        config:
          # Static receiver-specific config.
          password: secret
          # Dynamic configuration value.
          service_name: `pod.labels["service_name"]`
